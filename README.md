# AutoPkg Conductor

The `autopkg-conductor.sh` script is designed to do the following:

1. Detect a list of AutoPkg recipes at a defined location and verify that the list was readable.
2. If the AutoPkg recipe list was readable and available, run the following actions:

* Verify that AutoPkg is installed.
* Update all available AutoPkg repos with the latest recipes.
* Run the AutoPkg recipes in the list.

The AutoPkg run has all actions logged to `~/Library/Logs`, with the logfiles being named **autopkg-run-for-** followed by the date.

If the optional `slack_post_processor`, `slack_autopkg_processor` and `slack_webhook` variables are correctly populated, AutoPkg recipes for Jamf Upload or JSSImporter should have output sent to the Slack webhook specified in the `slack_webhook` variable.

My (@jby) version will strip out all info about repo updating and recipe running from output before sending to Slack webhook
